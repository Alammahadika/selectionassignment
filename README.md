# Selection Assignment - Data Analysis and Development Specialist 

Welcome to this repository!

This repository contains the solutions and analyses I developed as part of the selection assignment for the **Data Analysis and Development Specialist** position at the **University of Indonesia UI GreenMetric**.

I am very enthusiastic about this opportunity and have put in my best effort in analyzing the university data and sustainability indicators provided, and identifying relevant insights.

## Assignment Summary & Data

This assignment focuses on analyzing data from **100 universities from various countries**. The data provided includes several key UI GreenMetric indicators, represented as scores:

* **Score EC**: **Economic Contribution / Impact** – The university's contribution to the economy, such as graduates entering the workforce, startups, patents, etc. In this analysis, the EC Score is also interpreted as a reflection of the **Social Impact** generated by the university through its economic contributions and innovation.
* **Score WS**: **World Scientific / Web of Science** – Scientific publications in internationally reputable journals or citation score.
* **Score WR**: **World Ranking** – The university's relative position in global rankings (e.g., QS, THE, Shanghai Ranking).
* **Score TR**: **Teaching & Research** – The quality of teaching and research at the university (e.g., number of PhD faculty members, research funding).
* **Score ED**: **Education Delivery / Educational Development** – Curriculum quality, learning facilities, accessibility, and academic development.
* **Score SI**: **Social Impact** — The university's social contributions to society, such as community service activities, local collaborations, inclusiveness, the social impact of research, and its role in sustainable development.

The main objective of this assignment is to analyze this data to understand the **competitive position and academic strength** of the universities.

## 🌐 Continental University Insights via Radar Charts

These captivating radar charts offer a dynamic glimpse into the multifaceted performance of universities across **Asia**, **Europe**, **America**, and **Africa**. Each vibrant line traces the unique profile of a university across four critical **UI GreenMetric indicators**:

- **SI** – Social Impact  
- **WR** – World Ranking  
- **WS** – World Scientific Output  
- **EC** – Economic Contribution  

> 🧭 **Interpretation**: The farther a university’s line extends on an axis, the stronger its performance in that indicator.
